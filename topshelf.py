8. Recommendations for Further Exploration

1. Parameter Sensitivity Analysis:

	•	Objective: Understand how varying parameters like resonance_width, tunneling rates,
      and phase differences affect the size and shape of the suppression zone.
	•	Method: Systematically vary one parameter at a time and observe changes in the voltage map.

2. Quantum State Configuration:

	•	Objective: Explore how different quantum state configurations influence CPT and current suppression.
	•	Method: Experiment with varying the number of quantum states and their properties (e.g., amplitudes, phases).

3. Enhanced Visualization:

	•	Objective: Gain deeper insights into the dynamics of current suppression.
	•	Method: Use more sophisticated plotting techniques, such as heatmaps or contour plots,
      to better visualize regions of current flow and suppression.

4. Analytical Validation:

	•	Objective: Validate simulation results against theoretical predictions.
	•	Method: Compare the simulation’s suppression conditions with analytical models of CPT to ensure consistency.

5. Dynamic Simulation:

	•	Objective: Study how the system evolves over time under varying voltage conditions.
	•	Method: Introduce time-dependent bias or gate voltages and observe transient behaviors related to CPT.

Conclusion

The central suppression of current in your voltage map is a direct consequence of the system being in resonance
 at the midpoint of both bias and gate voltages. This resonance condition facilitates Coherent Population Trapping (CPT),
   where quantum interference effectively blocks current flow by forming dark states. The presence of multiple quantum states
     allows for this interference to occur selectively at the center, while surrounding regions remain unaffected due to the
       lack of optimal alignment for CPT.

By understanding and manipulating the interplay between bias and gate voltages,
 as well as the properties of your quantum states, you can further explore and fine-tune the conditions under which CPT suppresses current,
   thereby gaining deeper insights into the quantum dynamics of your system.
